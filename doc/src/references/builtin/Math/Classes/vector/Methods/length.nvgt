/**
	Retrieves the Euclidean length of the vector.
	float length();
	## Arguments:
		None.
	## Remarks
		It is important to emphasize this function returns the vector's Euclidian length (also known as its magnitude). This is calculated as sqrt((x * x) + (y * y) + (z * z)), which gives the distance from the origin (0, 0, 0) to the point represented by the vector.
		While this may sound abstract at first, it's extremely useful in many common scenarios. Some examples are:
		* Measuring distance: Use the length to find out how far a vector reaches from the origin. The vector (3, 4, 0) has a length of 5.0, meaning it's 5 units away in space.
		* Calculating speed: If a vector represents velocity, the length gives you the speed (how fast something is moving), while the vector's direction shows where it's going.
		* Collision detection: To determine how close two points are, subtract one position from another to get a direction vector, then use the length to measure the distance.
		If you are looking for the total size (I.E. number of units, volume etc), you will manually need to calculate this by using x * y * z.

void main() {
	vector v1(3, 4, 0);
	alert("Length", v1.length());
