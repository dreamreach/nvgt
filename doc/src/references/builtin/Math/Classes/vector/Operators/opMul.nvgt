/**
	Overloads the * operator, allowing you to multiply two vectors, or multiply one vector by a scalar.
	vector& opMul(const vector &in other);
	vector& opMul(float scalar);
	## Arguments (1):
		* const vector&in other: the vector to multiply.
	## Arguments (2):
		* float scalar: The scalar to multiply by.
	## Remarks
		Multiplying two vectors will, as you might imagine, multiply each axis independently. On the other hand, multiplying by a scalar will multiply all axes by that scalar.

// Example:
void main() {
	vector v1(1, 4, 8);
	vector v2=v1*3;
	alert("The second vector =", "(" + v2.x + ", " + v2.y + ", " + v2.z + ")");
}
