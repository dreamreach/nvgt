/**
	Overloads the / operator, allowing you to divide two vectors, or divide one vector by a scalar.
	vector& opDiv(const vector &in other);
	vector& opDiv(float scalar);
	## Arguments (1):
		* const vector&in other: the vector to divide by.
	## Arguments (2):
		* float scalar: The scalar to divide by.
	## Remarks
		Dividing two vectors will, as you might imagine, divide each axis independently. On the other hand, dividing by a scalar will divide all axes by that scalar.

// Example:
void main() {
	vector v1(3, 12, 24);
	vector v2=v1/3;
	alert("The second vector =", "(" + v2.x + ", " + v2.y + ", " + v2.z + ")");
}
