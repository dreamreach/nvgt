/**
	Set or retrieve the mode for the garbage collector. Default is 2 (see remarks below).
	int garbage_collect_mode;
	# Remarks
		This has a range of 1 to 3, where:
		1 is manual (you are responsible for calling the garbage_collect function when convenient).
		2 is automatic (called every wait() cycle on the main thread before sleeping).
		3 is asynchronous (same as 2, but called on a dedicated thread).
*/

// Example:
void main() {
	alert("GC mode", garbage_collect_mode);
}
